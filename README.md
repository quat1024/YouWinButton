You Win Button
==============

Button that makes you say win

It's like Vazkii's shitpost for 1.10, but this time it's a shitpost for 1.12 instead.

List of prizes for winning:

* win every advancement
* spam chat with the fact that you won
* win creative mode
* win an inventory full of diamonds
* win the love and affection of every entity
* win a screenful of fireworks *(uses fireworks code that I stoled form EnderCore btw)*
* win OP status on the server
* win every potion effect
* win a shitload of slimes
* nuke everyone's speakers who is playing on the server (play every vanilla sound event at the same time)
* win a title with ur name on it

IT'S BALANCED BECAUSE IT'S A MULTIBLOCK AND IT NEEDS NETHER STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You can configure it too, change the name of the game (so instead of "X won minecraft" it says "X won <your modpack name>"), change the multiblock, enable/disable certain prizes for winning
